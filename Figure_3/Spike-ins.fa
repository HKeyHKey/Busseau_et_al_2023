> r25 Spike-in for Small RNA-Seq (that's the wt bantam sequence, with the central UUG trinucleotide replaced by CGC, to allow us to distinguish them)

> r64 Spike-in for Small RNA-Seq (that's the m6 bantam sequence, with the central UUG trinucleotide replaced by CGC, to allow us to distinguish them; similar to r25 for wt and to r26 for m2)
